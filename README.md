# Password Manager by Manuel Dogbatse
Hi, this is my custom password manager made with Python and Docker.

To use this, make sure you have Docker Desktop installed on your computer. If not, click this link to download and install it: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Open Docker, then click on **pw_mg.bat** to start the password manager.
